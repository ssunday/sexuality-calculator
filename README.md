# Sexuality Calculator

[On S3](http://sexuality-calculator.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com)

This is still vaguely WIP. The questions could be phrased better for sure. If you have suggestions, please leave an issue or pull request.

Built with [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), and TypeScript.

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

## Linting

TypeScript, Prettier, and jsx-a11y linting.

`npm run lint:fix`

## Testing

- `npm run test`
- `npm run test:watch`

## Deploying

It's just an S3 bucket with static website hosting. Nothing fancy. Build the files, sync them up.
